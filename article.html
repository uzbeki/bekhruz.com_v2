        <p>"Knowledge is power", my teachers used to bore me with this phrase almost everyday. I did not have a clue
          about why it was so. Think about it. Practically, how on earth can something in your mind be a power? Does
          knowing what E=mc^2 make me more powerful? Not necessarily. BUT....</p>
        <p>Lately, I think more about how the world works as a whole. An example, look at the US, they have NASA that
          figured out how to get to the space, operate satellites, find efficient ways to fly metal objects, etc, etc,
          etc. In doing so, they had to innovate their way through difficulties , ex. they did not have powerful enough
          computers that could process large data obtained by their sensors. So they created one. As a result they
          became the only organization that knew how to build more powerful processors. NASA is a big example here, but
          their knowledge is all reflected in their technologies:</p>
        <p>- We use their GPS, they own our GPS data</p>
        <p>- The world is afraid of US Military Equipment Capabilities, aircraft carriers, bombers, .....</p>
        <p>- Their language took over the world, just because they innovated powerful technologies, not surprisingly, in
          English. So, the whole web is in English now, computer programming languages are in English. We have to learn
          their language in order to understand and use their new tech. The point I am trying to make here is they know
          how to do stuff that no one else does, not to show how the US is powerful.</p>
        <p>An easier example, look at Tesla. People did not take them seriously at first. Stuffing a bunch of new
          gadgets into a car was an absurd idea. Also, figuring out how to create an autonomous driving system in an
          environment where humans behave unexpectedly was considered out of reach using the current tech. And none
          wanted to spend time and effort to do the dirty work of getting into solving this huge problem, breaking it
          down into small doable parts. Tesla did, guess what? They seem to be making a great progress. Just because
          they know how to make a car drive autonomously in an acceptable way threw their stock price off the roof. Now
          competitors want a piece of Tesla knowledge. Does Tesla give them a middle finger, the hell it does! So,
          competitors realized they had no choice but go through the same path Tesla did years back with what they
          currently know, good luck!</p>
        <p>Take a look around now. Countries are battling with the time to be the first to create a working vaccine
          against Covid-19. The WHO called for a mutual collaboration in vaccine development. Did countries listen? Hell
          no. Ever wondered why? Great Britain, the US, Russia, China are all accusing each other of trying to steal
          information regarding the vaccine research. “ef the WHO's collaboration!”, said they. Each wants be the first
          one to create the vaccine. Let me put it in another way, if you haven't got it already: Each wants to be the
          first to KNOW HOW to make the vaccine. Why so?</p>
        <p>Is life like that? Does knowing how to do things that no one knows (or less people know) automatically put
          you ahead of others?</p>
        <p>This has been a long ass note. These are just my personal observations. I am still learning. I might change
          my mind at some point in life. Let me know what you think about knowledge being an ultimate power.</p>
